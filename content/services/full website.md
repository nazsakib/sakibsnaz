### 1. Design and Layout
I start by creating a visually appealing design that reflects your style and personality. Your website will be easy to navigate, ensuring visitors find what they need effortlessly.

I'll seamlessly integrate your contentâ€”text, images, and mediaâ€”making sure your portfolio tells your unique story. No hassle, just a polished presentation of your work.

### 3. Responsive Development
Your website will look fantastic on any device! I ensure it's responsive, so whether your visitors are on a computer, tablet, or phone, they get the best experience.
