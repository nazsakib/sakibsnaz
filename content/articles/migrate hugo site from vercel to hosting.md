Check out my recent YouTube video for a quick guide on smoothly shifting your Hugo site from Vercel to hosting. This move can save costs and give you more control over your website. First, make sure your site's on GitHub, then pick a hosting service that fits your needs. Set up your hosting, move your files over, and solve any problems that pop up. Test everything out to make sure your site works well in its new home. For more details, watch the video and make the switch with confidence.
