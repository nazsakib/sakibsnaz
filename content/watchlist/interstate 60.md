A nearly 20-hour power outage, the longest in recent memory, knocked out even my backup power after a few hours. Confined to my home and unable to work, I decided to watch a movie I'd downloaded months ago on my phone. Yearning for escape, I opted for this sci-fi epic and was transported to a world of stunning visuals and thought-provoking ideas. Wow, what a film!
