  - Understanding variables, data types, and operators.
  - Writing clean and effective JavaScript code.
- **Control Flow:**
  - Using conditional statements (if, else) for decision-making.
  - Employing loops (for, while) for iterative processes.
- **Functions:**
  - Defining and calling functions.
  - Understanding parameters and return values.
- **Arrays and Objects:**
  - Working with arrays and objects to organize data.
  - Accessing and manipulating array elements and object properties.
- **DOM Manipulation:**
  - Interacting with the Document Object Model (DOM).
  - Dynamically updating HTML and CSS using JavaScript.
- **Event Handling:**
  - Responding to user interactions through event listeners.
  - Enhancing user experience with interactive web elements.
