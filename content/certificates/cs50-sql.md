This is CS50’s introduction to databases using a language called SQL. In this course I learned:

- Introduction to databases using SQL in CS50.
- **CRUD** operations in relational databases (create, read, update, delete).
- Modeling real-world entities and relationships using tables.
- What is **ERD**
- Utilizing appropriate **types**, **triggers**, and **constraints**.
- Normalizing data to eliminate **redundancies** and **reduce errors**.
- Joining tables with primary and foreign keys.
- Automating searches with views and expediting with indexes.
- Connecting SQL with languages like **Python** and Java. But I choose Python.
- Beginning with **SQLite** for portability, ending with **PostgreSQL** and **MySQL for scalability**.
- Assignments inspired by **real-world datasets**.

I'm eager to leverage my SQL knowledge in managing and extracting insights from databases. Excited to contribute to projects that involve effective data management!
