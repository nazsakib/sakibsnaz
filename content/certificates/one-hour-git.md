  - Creating and cloning repositories, making and managing commits.
  - Utilizing branches for parallel development and merging changes.
- **GitHub Integration:**
  - Leveraging GitHub for collaborative development.
  - Initiating and managing pull requests to propose and merge changes.
  - Using GitHub as a remote repository for seamless collaboration.
