## Hello there!
### Welcome!

I work as a Technical Support Engineer at a Shopify-based SaaS app company, where I handle 450-500 live chats and tickets every month. My job is to solve technical issues, help customers, and make sure everything runs smoothly for Shopify store owners.

I have strong skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, Figma to HTML, jQuery, Bootstrap, and Tailwind CSS. I focus on creating and improving websites on Shopify and WordPress, helping businesses build great online stores and websites.

In my free time, I contribute to the WordPress.org official community, supporting the platform and helping other users.

I enjoy using my technical skills to fix problems and help customers achieve their goals. My goal is to make technology easier for everyone and deliver the best results.
